                        Just like Zelda he has a pure heart but unlike zelda he doesn't speak, but that doesn't exactly mean that he is emotionless. In the story of Breath of The Wild in Zelda's Diary, she states that with so much at stake, he finds it necessary to be strong and silently bear his burdens, which caused him to stop showing his emotions outward.
