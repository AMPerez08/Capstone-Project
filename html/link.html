                        Link as a character is vary intriguing to the eyes of the community since he doesn't just exist as a single individual. The different games act as a different link in a different point of time in a cycle of there being a decendent of the Hero of Time with the only exception to this time change being the games like "The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time" and "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask" which is with the same link. then the same thing happening again with "The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild" and "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom".

                        Just like Zelda he has a pure heart but unlike zelda he doesn't speak, but that doesn't exactly mean that he is emotionless. In the story of Breath of The Wild in Zelda's Diary, she states that with so much at stake, he finds it necessary to be strong and silently bear his burdens, which caused him to stop showing his emotions outward.

                        Link's Father was also a Knight of Hyrule, but surprisingly his family was not nobility. It is rumored that his hometown may have been Hateno Village since he was from the countryside. However Link's promotion to both Champion and personal bodyguard of the princess made some of the nobles unhappy.
