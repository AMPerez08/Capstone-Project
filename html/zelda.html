            <div class="history"><p>Zelda is the deuteragonist of "The Legend of Zelda" series. She is one of the key members of the Royal Family, and is the princess of the Kingdom of Hyrule and the daughter of its king, making her its second most powerful leader. However, in some games, she is listed as the primary or sole ruler. She is famously known to be the main love interest of Link, despite most media showing them as childhood friends or protector and protectee.</p></div>

                        In Breath of the Wild, she has a major speaking role for the first time in the main series. In game, Princess Zelda is not only the princess of Hyrule, but also an aspiring scholar who is very curious alongside being the leader of the Champions of Hyrule.

                        Zelda and Link are often paired together in the games, Link being the savior, and Zelda being the princess in need. However, Breath of the Wild introduces a deeper insight not only into Link's life, but Zelda's as well. Within flashbacks,  she became increasingly frustrated with her inability to prevent the impending doom of Calamity Ganon's return, of which was also fueled by her relationship with Link, Zelda believed that Link's path was relatively easy. Compared to the continual failures in fulfilling her role, Link always achieved anything he set his mind to. After Link saves Zelda from the Yiga, she opens up to him, learning that he also struggled with his role, faced with the crushing pressure of all of Hyrule expecting him to be the fearless hero who beats Ganon, eliminating failure.

                        She always wishes to do what is right for others and is extremely self-sacrificing. Though not always capable of defending herself or others on her own, she does not quit and tries to aid allies when she needs their help. She is also forgiving towards former enemies even when they have harmed her in someway. She is however, extremely loyal towards the ones she cares for (such as Link) and does not tolerate them getting harmed. She has a fondness for wildlife and nature, intrigued by the world around her.

                        Zelda's mother had passed when she was six years old, bestowing her with the mission of awakening the power of Goddess Hylia that laid dormant within her. Zelda was more interested in discovering the secrets of the Shiekah technology, from the Guardians to the Divine Beasts, to the Shrine of Trials that decorated Hyrule lands. After confronted by her father, she loses all hope in learning of the Shiekah, pushing all her time into praying to the Goddess Statues.
